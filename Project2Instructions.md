# **GROUP PROJECT #2: GitHub and collaboration with code**
## For this project, you will use your new groups. The goal of this project is to practice the workflow of social coding — learning to collaborate within a group on a common set of data. Each team will deliver a simple website that is hosted on Github.com using the Github Pages service. Github Pages is typically used to host an informational website about a technical project; in this case, there is no technical project behind the website, but you can just write a placeholder file (like a README file) to have something in the master branch, or you can create a group and make an organization page instead.

# **STEPS**

1. Create a new repository for your project using either the GitHub Organization Site or Project site model. You might want to consider creating a Github group to help you manage the people in your team and privileges around your repository.

2. Use GitHub Pages (and optionally the Jekyll static site generator) to create a website for your project: https://pages.github.com/

3. Start creating content. It doesn’t matter what you put here, but it should be somewhat substantive, and look polished. There should be a minimum of one content unit per team member on the site, and some images (for example, if you are using Jekyll to generate a blog, one blog post would count as a content unit). You can create a site for our course, or a pretend site for the (non-existent) technical project you created earlier, or even something completely unrelated to our class topic (like a site about a band or TV show, or collaboratively-written fiction). It’s really up to your group.

4. An important part of social coding is learning to resolve conflicts that arise when multiple people make conflicting changes to the same file; therefore, a requirement is that each content unit contain edits by at least two members of the team. I will be looking at the Github logs to see how these conflict situations are resolved. You should use the collaboration tools provided by Github to assist (such as Pull requests, and the Conversation mechanism that is provided). If these situations don’t naturally occur in your project, engineer them.

5. We will be looking at the sites as a class during the lab on 2/7. I will be grading this project on two criteria: how much you individually contributed to the project (as evidenced by the Github records), and how broadly your team used the version control features of git and the collaboration features available in Github. At a minimum, I expect at least one pull request per content unit in your site.
